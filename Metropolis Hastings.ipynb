    "The story in the introduction of the paper goes that the California state prison psychologist approached the Stanford statistics department to help them out with a problem: Prisoners were exchanging coded messages and they wanted to decode the messages. The folks at Stanford conjectured that the prisoners were systematically mapping characters to others using a fixed key---that is, they were using a substitution cipher---and used the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the key."
